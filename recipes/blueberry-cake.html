            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable shortening</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Topping</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>6 tbsp cold butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup toasted flake coconut</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Grease and flour a 9x9-inch square baking pan.</li>
            <li>Whisk 2 cups flour, baking powder, and salt together 
            in a mixing bowl; set aside. Toss the blueberries in a 
            little of the flour mixture until coated; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat the shortening and 1 cup sugar with an electric 
            mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg. 
            Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing 
            until just incorporated. Fold in the floured blueberries, 
            mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into 
            prepared pan.</li>
            <li>To make the topping, combine 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup flour, 
            and the cinnamon in a bowl. Cut in the cold butter with a 
            pastry blender until no small pieces of butter remain. 
            Stir in the toasted coconut, then sprinkle the topping 
            evenly over the cake.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 
            into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 
            minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to 
            cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
