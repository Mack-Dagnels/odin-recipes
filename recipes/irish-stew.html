        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm butter and oil in a multi-functional 
            pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) set 
            to Saute function. Add lamb and cook until browned 
            on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. 
            Add onion and shallots to the pot; cook and stir 
            until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and 
            cook for 1 minute longer.</li>
            <li>Pour wine into the pot and scrape up any browned 
            bits off the bottom of the pot. Cook until wine is reduced 
            by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Place carrots and potatoes on 
            top of onions. Season with rosemary and thyme; stir to combine 
            well. Arrange lamb over vegetables; pour beef broth on top.</li>
            <li>Close and lock the lid. Open vent for steaming. Select 
            Meat/Stew function; set timer for 20 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes 
            for pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according 
            to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, 
            mix water and potato starch until creamy.</li>
            <li>Unlock and remove lid. Switch to Saute function. Stir potato 
            starch mixture into the stew; cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Season with salt and pepper.</li>

        </ol>
